## About the Project

The **IntelliCart Billing System** tries to overcome the problem of slow bill generation and long queues, by adapting the usage of RFID tags instead of barcodes.

**RFID** (*Radio Frequency Identification*) is a technology that uses radio waves to track, capture, identify and transfer data efficiently and without human intervention. RFID - based system gathers data about a certain object without touching it or seeing its tag and forwards the information to a host computer. *RFID - Readers* are able to establish a channel of communication, read the tags and trace the movement of these objects within the coverage area
